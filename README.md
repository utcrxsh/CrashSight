# üöó CrashSight ‚Äì Real-Time Car Accident Detection with AI

CrashSight is a real-time car crash detection system that combines fast object tracking with deep scene understanding to identify accidents as they happen. It‚Äôs designed for real-world deployment on traffic footage ‚Äî smart intersections, fleet monitoring, or dashcams.

---

##  What It Does

- Detects vehicle collisions from raw video using computer vision
- Tracks object motion and dynamics across time
- Classifies crash patterns using an attention-enhanced CNN
- Outputs annotated clips, attention maps, and structured crash reports

---

##  System Overview

CrashSight runs a two-stage accident detection pipeline:

### 1. Vehicle Tracking & Motion Risk Analysis

- **YOLOv8** detects vehicles in each frame  
- A custom **Centroid Tracker** estimates speed, acceleration, and trajectory angles  
- Collision candidates are flagged when:
  - Bounding boxes intersect
  - Motion shows abnormal deceleration or direction change

### 2. Scene Understanding via Attention CNN

- **ResNet18 + TSM + CBAM + Multi-Head Attention**
- Learns crash semantics from over 1,000 labeled videos
- Produces heatmaps (via Grad-CAM++) showing model attention

### Triggering Logic

By default, Module 2 runs **only when Module 1 flags risk** ‚Äî either via bounding box collision or abnormal motion score.  
If hardware permits, both modules can run in parallel for full-score fusion:

```python
final_score = Œ± * motion_score + Œ≤ * scene_score
```

### Outputs

- üìπ Annotated video with bounding boxes, speed labels, collision tags  
- üå°Ô∏è Attention heatmaps (visual explanations)  
- üìù Structured crash reports (JSON & text)  
- üéûÔ∏è Accident clips in H.264 (annotated + raw)

##  Key Features

- Real-time: ~30 FPS (GPU) or 10‚Äì15 FPS (CPU)
- Risk scoring based on motion vectors + collision angles
- Scene classification with attention maps
- Velocity and acceleration tracking per vehicle
- Collision type estimation (e.g. rear-end, side-impact)
- Auto-generated video segments for detected crashes

##  Results

- **99% accuracy** on test set (1,000+ crash/no-crash clips)
- Detects edge cases missed by motion-only or scene-only models
- Auto-tags: rear-end, side-impact, angled collisions
- Generates structured reports (with velocity & class info)

##  Usage

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Detection on a Video

```bash
python main.py
```

Modify the paths in `main.py` to point to your input `.mp4` file and output directory.

### 3. Output Files

After processing, you'll get:

- `output_full.mp4` ‚Äì Full annotated video  
- `*_accident_*.mp4` ‚Äì Short clips for detected events  
- `collision_report.txt` ‚Äì Human-readable crash logs  
- `attention_summary.png` ‚Äì CNN attention visualization

##  Real-World Applications

- **Traffic Surveillance:** Monitor intersections for accidents in real time  
- **Fleet Monitoring:** Detect high-risk behavior across company vehicles  
- **Insurance:** Automatic documentation for claims  
- **Smart Cities:** Real-time road safety analysis  
- **Research:** Study vehicle dynamics in real-world crashes
