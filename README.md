# CrashSight - AI-Powered Car Accident Detection

This system automatically detects car accidents in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. Think of it as an intelligent surveillance system that can watch traffic footage and instantly identify when crashes happen.

## What It Does

CrashSight analyzes video feeds (from traffic cameras, dashcams, or security cameras) and automatically:
- Detects when accidents occur
- Tracks vehicles and their movements
- Creates detailed reports with video evidence
- Highlights exactly where the system "looked" to make its decision

## Why This Matters

Traditional accident detection relies on:
- Manual monitoring (expensive and prone to human error)
- Phone calls from witnesses (delayed response)
- Physical sensors (limited coverage)

CrashSight provides:
- **Instant detection** - No waiting for someone to report
- **24/7 monitoring** - Never gets tired or distracted  
- **Detailed evidence** - Automatic video clips and reports
- **Cost effective** - One system monitors multiple locations

## How It Works (Technical Overview)

I built this using a two-part approach:

### Part 1: Vehicle Tracking
- Uses YOLOv8 (state-of-the-art object detection) to find cars in video
- Tracks each vehicle's movement and speed
- Calculates risk scores based on sudden direction changes, speed shifts, and collision angles

### Part 2: Scene Understanding
- Uses a custom deep learning model (ResNet18 + attention mechanisms) to understand what's happening in the scene
- Trained on 1,000+ accident videos to recognize crash patterns
- Generates "attention maps" showing exactly what the AI focused on

### The Smart Part
Both systems work together - if one detects something suspicious, it cross-checks with the other. This reduces false alarms while catching real accidents.

## Key Results

- **99% accuracy** on test videos
- **Real-time processing** - works with live camera feeds
- **Handles edge cases** - catches accidents other systems miss
- **Low false positives** - won't trigger on normal traffic

## What You Get

When the system detects an accident, it automatically creates:

1. **Annotated video clip** - Shows bounding boxes around vehicles and their paths
2. **Attention heatmap** - Visual showing where the AI was "looking"
3. **Crash report** - JSON file with timestamps, vehicle info, and confidence scores
4. **Evidence package** - Everything saved in H.264 format for easy sharing

## Real-World Applications

- **Traffic Management**: City traffic centers can monitor intersections
- **Insurance**: Automatic crash documentation for claims
- **Fleet Management**: Monitor company vehicles
- **Research**: Analyze accident patterns for safety improvements
